Libraries used in program:
We have include stdio.h , string.h and stdlib.h
The header file stdio.h stands for Standard Input Output. It has the information related to input/output functions.
string.h is the header file required for string functions. This function appends not more than n characters from the string pointed to by src to the end of the string pointed to by dest plus a terminating Null-character.
The header file stdlib.h stands for Standard Library. It has the information of memory allocation/freeing functions.

Structure used in program:
Structure is a user-defined datatype in C language which allows us to combine data of different types together. Structure helps to construct a complex data type which is more meaningful. It is somewhat similar to an Array, but an array holds data of similar type only. But structure on the other hand, can store data of any type, which is practical more useful. 

For example: If we have to write a program to store passengers information, which will have Passengers name, date, destination, ticket code etc, which included string values, integer values etc. we cant use array for all this togather will require something which can hold data of different types together. In structure, data is stored in form of records.
